# rdf-proofs-wasm

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This library is a thin wrapper to convert [zkp-ld/rdf-proofs](https://github.com/zkp-ld/rdf-proofs) into WASM, making it accessible from TypeScript and JavaScript.
Note that this is still in an experimental phase and is not suitable for practical use.

## Usage

TBD
